🌟 Creating Your Project
Ready to start? Let’s get your project up and running:

# Create a new project in the current directory
npm create svelte@latest

# OR create a new project in the 'my-app' folder
npm create svelte@latest my-app

Setting up your project folder like a pro!

🛠️ Developing Your Project
Now that your project is set up, install the dependencies with:

bash
Copy code
npm install
# You can also use pnpm or yarn
Start the development server:
bash
Copy code
npm run dev
Want the server to open automatically in your browser? Try:

bash
Copy code
npm run dev -- --open

Watch your project come to life!

📦 Building for Production
When you’re ready to go live, create a production build:

bash
Copy code
npm run build
To preview the production build locally:

bash

Pro Tip: You may need an adapter for deployment to your target environment.
